"""
This module manages user data, players and quiz questions in a SQLite database using the sqlite3 library.
It provides the following functionality:
1. Database setup: Creates tables for players, scores, and questions if they do not exist in the database.
2. User registration: Adds a new user to the database with a unique username and birthday.
3. Age calculation: Calculates the age of a user based on their birthday.
4. Age saving: Saves the user's age in the scores table.
5. Quiz database creation: Creates a table for quiz questions if it does not exist.
6. Player retrieval: Fetches all players and their latest recorded age from the scores table.
