### Project: Brain Up - The Learning Adventure
### USER DOCUMENTATION

### 1. Introduction
“Brain Up: The Learning Adventure” is an interactive learning game for 9 to 12-year-olds that brings education to life through questions and answers in Science, English, and Māori Vocabulary, in the first version. Designed for two players, the game encourages knowledge growth and friendly competition, helping players build skills for future challenges.
This project utilizes Python to develop a game with a graphical user interface (GUI) using CustomTkinter and Pygame. These libraries are chosen to create an intuitive and user-friendly experience. An SQLite3 database will be used to store players names and ages, questions and game data, such as leaderboards and performance history, ensuring data persistence. GitHub will serve as a central repository for collaborative development.
